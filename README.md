Two 4 Columns tables: Responsive and Grid

In this project i developed two row tables with 4 columns.
First one with origin responsible styling and second one with grid.

We could see that grid system is much more useful. It's not needed to adopt the height of the boxes all the time.

I recommend to use CSS:Grid because of easy concept and high productivity.
